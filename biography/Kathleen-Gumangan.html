          <h2 class="">Kathleen Gumangan</h2>
          <p>
            Cathleen A. Sagun is a 17-year-old grade 12 student at Saint Vincent’s Catholic School of Bayambang Inc. Born on November 12, 2005, in Bautista, Pangasinan. Cathleen is a dedicated student who has chosen the HUMSS academic track. She comes from a loving family, with her mother, Joanne Sagun, taking care of her and her siblings while her father, Roberto Sagun, works hard to provide for their needs. Cathleen has two brothers and one sister, with her oldest sister, Caryl Jae Sagun, having completed high school at the age of 19 and now working. Her youngest brother, Iver Sagun, is currently a grade 1 student at Cabuaan Elementary School.

            Cathleen’s love for education began at the age of 4 when she was enrolled in a nursery at a nearby Day Care Center. She was inspired by her brother who would go to school every day, and imagined that school was like a joyful playground where she could gain knowledge and make friends. Throughout her school years, Cathleen has created lasting memories with her classmates, teachers, and friends, considering them her second family. She cherishes the unforgettable moments and best memories they have shared over the years. Despite the occasional fatigue, Cathleen finds herself enjoying school every day, as it has become a place where she truly feels at home.
            
            With a multitude of dreams in life, Cathleen is already taking steps to make them come true. She finds joy in spending time with friends and exploring new places with them. At times, she prefers staying at home, watching movies with her family, and indulging in tasty, salty snacks. Cathleen also enjoys watching vlogs and lifestyle videos on YouTube, applying the knowledge she gains to her own life. However, one thing that truly bothers her is when someone disturbs her while she is working on important school assignments. Despite facing various challenges, Cathleen considers herself lucky to have a complete and supportive family. Together, they have overcome many difficulties without allowing them to break their bond.
