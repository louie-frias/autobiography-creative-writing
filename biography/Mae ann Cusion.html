          <p>
            Pauleen is a 17-year-old from Pangdel Bayambang, Pangasinan. She enjoys spending time with her friends, playing volleyball, and playing online games. Pauleen has a passion for cooking and her favorite dish is adobo. She also has a love for jokes and finds humor to be enjoyable.

            There are a few things that Pauleen dislikes, such as okra, which she really hates. She also has a dislike for pumpkin soap because she finds it too soft in the mouth. Despite these dislikes, Pauleen is generally happy with her life.
            
            Pauleen greatly admires her father and considers him her favorite person because he is a very good parent. He works hard every day to ensure that their needs, especially food, are met. She is grateful for her family and loves her parents dearly as she always feels their love.
            
            As the eldest of three siblings, Pauleen shares that her father wants her to become a flight attendant so she can follow in the footsteps of her sister. In addition to her family, Pauleen finds happiness in her friends and loved ones. She also enjoys watching Korean dramas, playing online games, and her hobby is watching TikTok.
            
            When there is no school, Pauleen and her family visit their cousin who passed away from cancer. She always prays that after finishing her studies, she can fulfill her father’s dream and provide for their needs. Pauleen’s main challenge in life is to finish school and work hard to achieve her dreams.
            
            As a child, Pauleen had a traumatic experience with a dog as she was bitten multiple times. She didn’t initially share this with her parents because she was afraid of their reaction. However, when she finally told her mother, she was scolded for not disclosing it earlier. This experience has led Pauleen to distance herself from dogs as she fears being bitten again.
            
            During her teenage years, Pauleen faced insecurity due to having a lot of pimples. She believed that she was the only one who was ugly because she received scolding and comments about her acne. These comments made her cry and question her self-worth. Despite these insecurities, Pauleen has plans for her future.
            
            Pauleen’s plan is not to attend college but to work abroad to support her family’s needs and buy the things they want. This decision brings her to tears, especially when she sees her tired parents working hard. Although it is difficult to be away from her family, Pauleen believes that taking a job abroad is a better option than pursuing higher education.
            
            This is a brief biography of Pauleen, highlighting her interests, family dynamics, challenges, and aspirations.
