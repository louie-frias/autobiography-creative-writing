          <p>
            She’s aware that she’s young, but she already has a version of where she wants to be in the future. It all started with this little dreamer, happy and innocent. Until life made her realize that the time was ticking so fast. She struggles a lot, but no one knows what to do here. Been through, but one day everything will turn out fine. And yes, life is hard, but it is so very beautiful. She’s Allysa Mae Cariño Ragos, but you can call her “Allysa.” She was born on the 9th of February, in the year 2006. 17 years of age. And she’s the youngest in their family. And she lives in Barangay Paragos, Bayambang, Pangasinan. She graduated from Junior High School at Bayambang National High School. And currently, she’s a Senior High School student at Saint Vincent’s Catholic School of Bayambang, Inc.

            And, these are the things that she’s actually good at. First is dancing. Yes, she really loves to dance. She really missed doing it at school, but now she doesn’t know if she’s gonna do it again. She loves to draw, but she’s not really good at it. She also plays guitar and sings, and lastly, she likes boosting her self-esteem. So let’s move on to her hobbies. She loves watching the beautiful nature and sky. Also, she likes anime, Kdrama, and movies, and she also likes posting videos on TikTok and playing online games. Spending time with her family and friends makes her really happy. And someday, she sees herself as a successful police officer. And they always ask Allysa, “Why did you choose to become a police woman?” And she said that “She chose to study law not only because it was her dream but also to help others, and she’s confident with her abilities.” If she can do it, then they can do it too, believe her. All your sacrifice, silent cries, and hard work will pay someday.
            
            Let’s talk about her childhood memories. She has many childhood memories. Here, she will be sharing the one that is the most memorable to her. In her childhood, they used to go to her grandparents’ house at least once a year. They mostly visit their grandparents’ house during her school summer vacation. She remembers that when she was a child, her one brother was always her enemy because his brother always tripped her up. There was a day when her brother was the only one left at home because their parents went then, she had to go in because it was noon. But, her brother is not awake yet because her brother is the one who will feed her and take her to school. So, what she did was she poured water on his bed while his brother was sleeping, and that surprised him and his brother woke up. Her brother was angry with her, so they fought and his brother chased her. But, his brother couldn’t take her back, so he took a shower and ate, then his brother took her to school.
            
            They she was a child, she was kind and naughty. Then, she wandered around so she met Johnrey and Nica. Johnrey is her gay friend. Johnrey was kind, he accompanies her in all her wanderings and Nica is her friend. Nica is also a nice friend, of course, but just stingy. One day she called them both to wander; they agreed, so Allysa was so happy with that. They arrived far away, and it was getting late. Nica is nervous because it’s too late, but Johnrey is enjoying that night. An hour has passed since their tire got a puncture, so they are nervous and scared because it's late at night, there is nothing we can do. So they walked home with her friend. There was a mixture of fear when they got home, but she was happy. Her friend is funny all the time. When Nica and Johnrey was a child, they were always present for her pranks. One day they went to school, and then she asked them to skip class to go to the river and bathe. They tagged, reed, and were bathed while they were enjoying bath. She suddenly went into deep, she was afraid because she didn’t know how to swim, but she knew how Nica swam and saved her. When Nica finished saving her, they went home because they suddenly got scared. Since then, they haven’t bathed in the river. Johnrey and Nica are her friends from then until now; they are the ones who are always there by her side; they are her ranting persons; they are the ones she tells her problems to, and they are the ones who are always there for her. They never leave Allysa, even when she’s very naughty; they were the ones who were by Allysa’s side when she felt like she couldn’t handle the problems that came her way; they both gave Allysa strength, so she never gets tired of loving and understanding them.
            
            When Allysa was 7 years old, her parents gave her a big Teddy Bear as her birthday gift. They even celebrate her birthday party. The pleasure of outdoor games in all kinds of weather, getting out in the rain or soaking in sand and every morning and afternoon. Allysa and her friends played, can never come back again. The golden days were tension-free and care-free from all duties and responsibilities. Even the fights had their own charm. Not every memory Allysa has a happy one. Some are uuncomfortable and even touchy. One of it was the passing of her grandmother. Allysa once awoke to the sound of crying coming from her grandmother’s living room there, they ran. Allysa’s grandmother was covered in a white sheet and was lying on her bed. She couldn’t accept the fact that her mom was no longer with them. He sobbed because she was so shocked. It was her first experience with a death scene. She’ll never forget that terrible thing that happened to her.
