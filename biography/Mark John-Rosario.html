          <p>
            Have you ever wondered what life is like for someone like Mae-Ann?She is Mae Ann C. Cuison, 17 years old and she was born on May 02, 2006, at San Vicente Bayambang Pangasinan. She is a product of province life, She  was born and raised there with her parents. Life there was so simple, away from pollution and away from new techs, however, life is still difficult for them to survive on day to day basis.


            She is  the 5th of 8 siblings, her father was a carpenter and her mother is taking care of them. During the night time, even though her  father is tired, he still works overtime to buy rice and their allowance every day in school. Mae Ann and her siblings also try their  luck on weekends and holidays Mae ann and her siblings wake up earlier to help their mother with household chores to make them easier so that they can cook food especially for their father that is tired from work so that he can rest properly after eating because her father never wastes a day because even on Saturdays and Sundays, he is still working for them to buy them a food so that they can have something to eat, to relieve their father’s fatigue when he comes home they greet him with a tight hug. That’s has been their routine for so many years She must say that she would never be ashamed of having that kind of life but instead being grateful for it because it does not only build her as a better person now but thinking that she was blessed enough to have the people around her that loved and cared for her.
            
            
            In addition, it’s not easy for the to make money for their everyday needs but they are very happy way back there as they have each other through thick and thin. Furthermore, they also experienced being nothing and struggle due to financial problems but they remain steadfast and facing all those arduous situations with a positive outlook. All of the hardships that they encountered way back then, mold her to be the firm and wise woman now.
            
            
            She had graduated my Elementary in the province and finished her grade 10 at Bilad High School Camiling Tarlac being a consistent honor student and now Grade 12 student in St. Vincent’s Catholic School of Bayambang Inc. and here became the first batch of government scholars from her voucher which the government provides for those Junior High School students particularly her who are came from public school.
            
            
            She endured so many obstacles and downs during my grade 11 as a part Senior High School life sometimes feel depressed it's because she can't balance her time properly between her responsibilities at house and school works. She also do a part-time job at that time and it wouldn’t easy for her to manage everything. But thinking with her family would help her boost my strength and keeps her going. Since she’s a working student she’s lucky to have a very caring Boss but she was told her that mae ann can treat her as my sister. She encouraged Mae Ann to move forward and continue learning. Her Senior High life was so exhausted, many challenges, a lot of learnings, and fond memories that she will cherish forever.
