            Ryan Amper  is a 19-year-old from Bongato East Bayambang, Pangasinan. He enjoys spending time with his friends, playing mobile games and playing card games. Amper has a passion for cooking, his favorite dish is Bicol express. He also loves joking around and finds humor to be enjoyable.

            There are a few things that Amper dislikes, such as Balsam apple, which he really hates. He also has a dislike for dog soap because he finds it too soft in the mouth. Despite these dislikes, Amper is generally happy with his life.
            
            Amper greatly admires her Mother and considers his favorite person,  because she is a very good parent, she works really hard to provide the wants of their family. He is grateful for his family and loves his parents dearly as he always feels their love.
            
            As the youngest of the four siblings, Amper shares that his father wants him to become a Police so he can follow the footsteps of his uncle. In addition to his family, Amper finds happiness in his friends and loved ones. He also enjoys watching hollywood movies, Tiktok, Facebook reels, anime cartoons and he also enjoys playing online games. 
            
            When there is no school, amper and his family never forget to visit their grandfather who passed away from old age. He always prays that after finishing his studies, he can fulfill his grand father’s dream and provide for their needs. Amper’s main challenge in life is to finish school and work hard to achieve his dreams.
            
            As a child, Amper had a traumatic experience with a dog as he was bitten multiple times. He didn’t initially share this with his parents because he was afraid of their reaction. How ever, when he finally told her mother, he was scolded for not disclosing it earlier. This experience has led Amper  to distance himself from dogs as he fears being bitten again.
            
            During his teenage years, Amper faced insecurities due to having a lot of acnes. He’s ashamed of his acne because he always received scolding and comments about his acne. These comments made him feel insecure and question her self-worth. Despite of all these insecurities, Amper find himself a worth loving person and still handsome. 
            
            Amper’s plan is to run their family business from her mother, and that’s his way to support their family needs and buy the things they want. This decision brings him to tears, especially when he sees his tired parents working hard. Although it is difficult to be away from his family, Amper believes that taking a job as a vendor is a better option than pursuing higher education, but he needed to graduate to be come a great police man in the near future. 
            
            This is a brief biography of Amper, highlighting his interests, family dynamics, challenges, and aspirations.
