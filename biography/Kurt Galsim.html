           His name is Mark John G. Salumbre,and he’s  17 years old and he was born in Buayaen, Bayambang Pangasinan on March 21, 2006. When he was a kid, he used to be joyful and playful but when he reached the teenage year, he became quiet and reserved. But when he’s with people that he was comfortable with, like his family and friends he really talks a lot. And he think’s  that as one of the characteristics of being an introvert. His hobbies to past time are playing basketball and watching anime. Apparently he was one of the players in one of the basketball teams in their barangay and are competing in basketball tournament held in their barangay. His favorite dish is Adobo. With regards to his relationship with his family. He can say that he have a strong relationship with them specially with his parents. He always tell them about the happenings in his life especially school stuffs and sometimes he ask for their advice for the things that requires decision making since they have more wisdom and experience in life. He  have five siblings and he can say that they have a great relationship with each other since they grew up together, even though they often have petty fights which he think is normal, he know’s that they still have each other’s back no matter what. He love’s his family and he is willing to do everything that he can to protect them. Outside their home, he have a lot of friends that he  considered as his brothers. He spent most of his day hanging out with them, playing basketball, and going to church and other places. Sometimes they face some misunderstandings  and he thinks its maybe because of their  differences but they always choose to talk about it and settle everything and because of that he think that their friendship will last until they get older. At school, he considered himself as a regular student. He says that he was not that smart, but he assure’s  that he is not failing in his academics. He enjoy going to school because he  can spend time with his classmates and learn new things which can help him to reach his goal. His goal was to graduate in senior high school and go to college or university where he can learn and get a degree for his chosen career as a Marine Engineer in the future. He want to become successful Marine Engineer because aside from it is his childhood dream, he know’s that this profession will help him to become financially independent so that he will be able to pay back for all the sacrifices that his family has done for him. He really hope and pray that God will lead to the right path in achieving his goals in life. And he believes that Having goals that we are passionate about gives us something to look forward to each morning when we wake up.
