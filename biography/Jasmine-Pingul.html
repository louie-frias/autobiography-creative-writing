            “A Short Biography about Ranjit Singh”

            A goal-getter who loves basketball is what best describes him. When you first see him, there is no way that your eyes would believe that the tall guy, almost six feet, you’re looking at is just a grade 12 student. His distinct feature makes him stand out from the crowd. But who would’ve thought that this towering student has a great passion for serving the community.
            
            Ranjit F. Singh, or more commonly known as “Jit” by his peers and family, is a half Filipino and half-Indian who was born on the 2nd of March 2005 to his parents, Shingara and Noemi. He has a sister named Jesha, and a girlfriend who he has been with for five years. 
            
            When he was a kid, he was described as someone who was very joyful and has always appreciated everything in his life. From such a young age, he had already learned the value of family, friendships, and the genuine acceptance of people around him even if he isn’t a full-blooded Filipino.
            
            Apart from that, he also learned a lot of lessons from the schools that he went into. Like, when he first started studying at Mother Goose School in Bayambang. He was able to learn about the things that he truly likes and made him see the real purpose of a school, which was creating friendships, memories, and learnings that would last for a long time. This was also the time when he found out about his passion for the sport basketball.
            
            As he moved to the next chapter of his life, he also needed to move to a different school. But even after moving to a totally different school, his love for basketball has never changed. He had even described basketball as not just a random sport that he would play, instead it is a sport where he had learned the true meaning of discipline, teamwork, and determination.  With his astounding height and great gameplay, there is no doubt that this dream of his would come to fruition.
            
            Upon moving to his new school for senior high school, his passion for basketball still hasn’t changed and continues to improve even more. But that wasn’t the only thing that he was able to improve on himself. Because, later on he found out that he also has a passion for being a public servant. In the same year, he had decided to run for the position of SK chairman in his barangay. He wanted to do this because he wants to give back to the community that had played a significant role in shaping the person that he is right now and the perfect way for him to do this is through serving his community. Even though he wasn’t able to successfully win in the elections, he continues to serve and inspire people through his good deeds and actions.
            
            All people have their own story to share. For Ranjit, he also had his own fair share of hardships in his life. But as the bright and vibrant person that he is, he always chooses to stay positive and never loses hope. He serves as a reminder to everyone that there are a lot of things that we can learn in our life, lots of opportunities and chances that will help us improve our lives and help us become a better version of ourselves. But this would only happen if we chose to appreciate it.
