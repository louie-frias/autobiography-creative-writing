            Lheo Macaraeg Frias is a 17-year-old who grew up in a devout Catholic family. The church played a central role in his life, and during a Sunday mass, he felt a strong calling to serve the Lord more closely. Inspired by the altar servers he saw assisting the priest, Lheo approached Father Noel, their parish priest, and expressed his desire to become an altar server.

Welcomed with open arms, Lheo began his training, committing himself to this sacred duty. He learned the intricacies of serving at the altar, from holding the cross during processions to understanding the liturgical calendar. On his first day as an altar server, he felt nervous but soon found a sense of calm as he realized he was exactly where he was meant to be.

Being an altar server went beyond simply assisting during mass for Lheo. It was a responsibility that required utmost reverence and respect. He learned to handle the holy vessels with care and to be attentive to the needs of the priest and the congregation. Serving at the altar deepened his connection with his church community, allowing him to be more involved in various church activities and make lifelong friends who shared his faith and values.

Lheo’s time as an altar server taught him valuable lessons in discipline, humility, and service. It strengthened his relationship with God and helped him grow in his faith. As he grew older, his responsibilities at the altar evolved, and he had the honor of training new altar servers, passing on the knowledge and experience he had gained over the span of nine years.

Although Lheo’s time as an altar server has come to an end, its impact on his life is eternal. The lessons he learned, the friendships he made, and the deepening of his faith are treasures he carries with him always. As he reflects on his journey, he is filled with gratitude for the opportunity to serve the Lord in such a meaningful way.

Now, as Lheo passes the torch to the next generation of altar servers, he hopes they will find the same joy, fulfillment, and spiritual growth that he did. The altar may be a place of service, but it is also a place of transformation, where ordinary people like Lheo are called to do extraordinary things in the name of the Lord.
