          <h2 class="">Jan Dexter De Guzman</h2>
          <p>
            “Dexter: Brazen Detour” <br /><br />

One rainy morning on the 12th day of February 2005 at Davao city, I was born. Molded and guided by my parents Mr. and Mrs. Roderick Patayan, I am now grown into a seventeen year old fine lad fully equipped to conquer the real world. I am Jan Dexter Ayupan De Guzman, an aspiring AFP Military Officer.  <br /><br />

My childhood was a time of wonder and exploration. As the first born son, I always felt the pressure burdening me but I never let it hold me down from doing all the activities that joy my heart. I was fortunate to have loving parents who instilled in me the values of empathy and hardwork. When I was a kid, me and my brother who is one year younger than me often go out with the same clothes. People around us would often call as twins because even our haircuts were matching and we credit our lovely mother for that. <br /><br />

I started my elementary education at Baluyot Bautista Pangasinan where I developed a strong foundation in reading, writing, and most importantly, sports. During those early years, I discovered my love for sports. I joined the volleyball team of our school even though it was a bit risky for me as I have asthma. However, that did not stop me. <br /><br />

As I go toward my high school life at Saint Vincent’s Catholic School of Bayambang Inc., I continued learning various sports activities. I am indeed grateful that my parents are supportive of me. During these years, I was just a typical junior high school boy who goes to school, study, goes home, and rest for the day. Due to the pandemic, we were not able to enjoy our junior high school life as how others perceive it. We were locked on the four corners of our room wondering when will we ever experience those romanticized experiences everyone is talking about.  <br /><br />

Moving forward to my senior high school life, still in the same school, I met my now almost two years girlfriend who became one of my support system. She does not refrain me from doing all the normal things a teenager does unlike other girlfriends. Instead, she encourages me to experience all these because I deserve it as a young lad. However, I choose to stay focused and invested on factors that affect my overall well being rather than those doings “just for experience”. <br /><br />

Now, as a senior, I promise to be more active academically as what my girlfriend always tell me. As someone who likes to plan my future, I dedicate this last year of my high school life for academic learning because I am being inspired by my girlfriend who is a really smart and bright woman. <br /><br />

Consequently, I feel delighted as I look back on the journey I have been through. It was a journey of ups and down. I lost people who were a great part of my life which took a toll on me for the longest time even until now but what I am being optimistic about is that I am still blessed with people who supports and love me for who I am, a person who continuously strive to be his best self. <br /><br />
