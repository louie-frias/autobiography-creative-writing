          <h2 class="">Mark John Rosario</h2>
          <p>
            Not too many people could walk a mile in your shoes. Only you know your struggles, challenges, and obstacles; so be proud of how far you have come.”
            –Edmond Mbiaka <br /><br />

My name is Mark John C. Rosario from San Gabriel 2nd, Bayambang Pangasinan. My Birthdate is on August 25,2006 so I am 17 years old now and I am very happy and blessed with what I have now and what I am now because of what I have been through and what happened in life, Let me tell you everything. <br /><br />

I used to be a valedictorian from nursery to grade 6 because when I was a child I was always at home and I didn't leave depending on when there were family gatherings or occasions. Maybe I was just lazy when I went out because I didn't have friends because my cousins ​​are far away and maybe because I have strict parents especially my mom because she is a teacher so she prefers that I learn to read or write instead of playing outside. Back then I was always annoyed with mom because she only made me read and memorize but I couldn't do anything because she would beat me so I just obeyed until the day came when our teacher suddenly gave us a test without our knowledge and that's it because I read and studied that I am the highest among us and all my classmates didn't pass because they didn't know so I was excited to go home and I immediately told mom what score I got and this is exactly what I said to her "Thank you Mom because you memorized it, that's why I was able to answer our quiz." This is what I said to mom, so she burst into tears and suddenly hugged me until I got older and graduated from elementary school and when I became high school, a lot of things happened to me. <br /><br />

I deeply regretted that I was blocked to the point that I was neglecting my studies. It came to the point that I didn't get honors becausehad a circle of friends who were lazy to study so I cried a lot and apologized to mom and of course she got angry but after a while she said that I should recover now that I'm going to senior high. Even though she knew that she would struggle financially, sheworked harder just so that I could enter a private school. And now that I'm in grade 12, I know I'm going to face a new opportunity and a new challenge, so my mom says that I just need hard work, perseverance and determination to graduate and have a good career and future, these are some of my problems now grade 12 there is the problem with money because the projects are expensive and especially when my friends and I had a misunderstanding and I was the one who was bad at their story to the point that I didn't want to go in because I would only see them and might be defamed again. <br /><br />

I was very depressed about that and I told my mom so she gave me advice and she said I should just let them go as long as I know I didn't do anything wrong and they say that when something goes missing something comes, so I just let it go until they go away and I'm happy because I had new friends that I met in volleyball when there was a try out at our school. That's why I think they're the ones I can be with because they're not just my friends in sports or silly because I'm also with them in being academic achievers and they're the ones I approach every time I'm sad and they're the only ones I've solved problems with because I feel that they don't judge me but correct me and help me improve and make my life easier. <br /><br />

So, now that I'm a senior high student, I'm getting awards and I've made my promise to mom that I'll get back and thank you because she's always there to cheer me up and lighten my heart because I admit that I'm not a perfect child because I can answer her and ignore her but she never left me that's why I'm so very contented and overwhelmed that she's my mom because to be honest if I had to choose who was the bravest? it's my mom because no matter what trials come her way? she never gave up and she never let me down. She always put me first, she will do everything for me, she knows when to make me feel better and she always supports me in everything I want. And because of what she showed, I believe in the saying that Mama knows best and my Mom is super the best! <br /><br />

So, now that I have graduated from grade 12 and my college phase is about to start, I will improve my studies even more so that I can graduate because that is what she wants for me so I will study hard and I will finish my studies so I can show that everything she did was worth it and I appreciate it. And the end of the day she will see that her youngest son will be the next teacher like her. <br /><br />
