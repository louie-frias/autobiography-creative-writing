          <h2 class="">Mark John Salumbre</h2>
          <p>
           My name is Mark John G. Salumbre, I' am 17 years old and was born in Buayaen, Bayambang Pangasinan on March 21, 2006. I can say that I had a great childhood because the good experiences that I had. When I was a kid, I used to be joyful and playful but when I reached my teenage year, I became quiet and reserved. But when I am with people that I am comfortable with, like my family and friends I really talks a lot. I think that one of the characteristics of being an introvert. My hobbies for my past time are playing basketball and watching anime. Currently, I am one of the players in one of the basketball teams in our barangay and we are competing in basketball tournament held in our barangay. My favorite dish is Adobo With regards to my relationship with my family. I can say that I have a strong relationship with them specially with my parents. I always tell them about the happenings in my life especially school stuffs and sometimes I ask for their advice for the things that requires decision making since they have more wisdom and experience in life. I have five siblings and I have a great relationship with them since we grew up together, even though we often have petty fights which I think is normal, I know that we still have each other’s back no matter what. I love my family and I am willing to do everything that I can to protect them. Outside our home, I have a lot of friends that I considered as my brothers. I spent most of my day hanging out with them, playing basketball, and going to church and other places. Sometimes we face some misunderstandings maybe because of our differences but we always choose to talk about it and settle everything and because of that I think our friendship will last until we get older. At school, I considered myself as a regular student. I am not that smart, but I assure that I am not failing in my academics. I enjoy going to school because I can spend time with classmates and learn new things which can help me to reach my goal. My goal is to graduate in senior high school and go to college or university where I can learn and get a degree for my chosen career as a Marine Engineer in the future. I want to become successful Marine Engineer because aside from it is childhood dream, I know that this profession will help me to become financially independent so that I will be able to pay back for all the sacrifices that my family has done for me. I really hope and pray that God will lead to the right path in achieving my goals in life. PHRASE: Having goals that we are passionate about gives us something to look forward to each morning when we wake up. One part at a time, one day at a time, we can accomplish any goal we set for ourselves just believe you can and you’re halfway there.
