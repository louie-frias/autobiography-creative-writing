          <p>
            Hi Iâ€™m Lheo Macaraeg Frias, 17 yrs old. This is my Story Begins. Growing up in a devout Catholic family, the church was the centerpiece of my life. It was during one Sunday mass that I felt a strong calling to serve the Lord more closely. I saw the altar servers assisting the priest and realized that was how I wanted to contribute to my church community. I approached Father Noel, our parish priest, and expressed my desire to become an altar server. He welcomed me with open arms, and soon I began my training. It was a serious commitment, and I learned everything from the proper way to hold the cross during processions to the intricate details of the liturgical calendar. I'll never forget my first day as an altar server. The nerves were palpable as I donned my crisp white robe and lit the candles before the mass. But as soon as the processional hymn began, a sense of calm washed over me. I knew I was exactly where I was meant to be. <br /><br /> 
The Sacred Duty Being an altar server was more than just assisting during mass. It was a sacred duty that required utmost reverence and respect. I learned to handle the holy vessels with care and to always be attentive to the needs of the priest and the congregation. The Community Connection Serving at the altar deepened my connection with my church community. I became more involved in various church activities and made lifelong friends who shared my faith and values. It was a beautiful experience to be a part of something larger than myself. The Lessons Learned My time as an altar server taught me many valuable lessons. I learned the importance of discipline, humility, and service. It also strengthened my relationship with God and helped me grow in my faith. <br /><br />
A Journey of Faith As I grew older, my responsibilities at the altar evolved. I had the honor of training new altar servers and sharing the knowledge and experience I had gained over the years ( 9 years). It was a journey of faith that shaped me into the person I am today. From the Altar to Eternity My time as an altar server may have come to an end, but the impact it had on my life is eternal. The lessons I learned, the friendships I made, and the deepening of my faith are treasures that I carry with me always. As I look back on my journey from the altar, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunity to serve the Lord in such a meaningful way. <br /><br />
Passing the Torch Now, as I pass the torch to the next generation of altar servers, I hope they find the same joy, fulfillment, and spiritual growth that I did. The altar may be a place of service, but it is also a place of transformation, where ordinary people like me are called to do extraordinary things in the name of the Lord. <br /><br />
