          <h2 class="">Ann Zhyra Kate Vismanos</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Ann Zhyra Kate Camacho Vismanos I'm 17 years old I was born on August 26, 2005 in Bayambang. My parents is Amy C. Vismanos and Marlon Esmael Vismanos I have 2 sisters my sister is studying in Malasique Perpetual 3 years in Collage and my youngest sister is grade 11 and my Religion is Islam my father is died 1 year ago in December 26, 2021 in age of 41 years old and my mom is a housekeeping and farmer. <br /><br />

Our family was simple happy when my father was alive but when he died, my family was full of sadness. I couldn't eat well when my father died I couldn't accept his death, but several years and months have passed. We slowly accepted that he was dead and we started to get up again. My mother and my two sisters and my father is very kind he gives us everything we want, he is always in our hearts and mind and we always pray for him. <br /><br />

I remembered when I was 3 year's old, I wanted to go to school because I saw my sister going to school and I told my mom that I wanted to go the daycare center with my sister and my mom enrolled me in school I imagine that school is just a like a playground that makes everybody happy. <br /><br />

When I went to highschool, I became more active in activities and many friends who became important in my life and had happy memories

And the year passed and now I am a Senior High School student studying in private school in SVCSBI, I'm a person that want to achieve my dream is a good life, just simple, and when I step into College my dream is to become a Nurse one day instead of just studying hard so I could get the job I want became a Nurse. Don't give up on my dream because my dad told me what I should take in college is a Nurse I will improve my studies so that my dad in heaven will be proud of me one day my mom and dad is my inspiration

I want to thank my mom because even though she is the only one who lives with us, she is the only one who supports us as. She never leaves us alone she always guide us, there is no one to live because our dad is die that's my life story. <br /><br />
