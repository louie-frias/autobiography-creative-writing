          <h2 class="">Samantha Magtaan</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Samantha Jane I. Magtaan, 17 years old and I was born on December 15, 2005 in Bayambang,  Pangasinan. live in Bongato East, Bayambang, Pangasinan. I am the daughter of William D. Magtaan and Maricel I. Magtaan, my father is a Construction Worker and my mother is working on abroad as an OFW to give all my needs and to financial support. I'm a grade 12 student that took academic track in the strand of HUMSS at Saint Vincent Catholic School Of Bayambang, Inc. (SVCSBI). <br /><br />

I started studying at Bongato East Elementary School, I studied my kindergarten to grade 6 there, I entered High School at Bautista National High School, after finishing grade 10 in Bautista, I decided to transfered in Saint Vincent Catholic School of Bayambang, Inc. for my Senior High School and currently I am now a Senior High School at Saint Vincent Catholic School Of Bayambang, Inc.(SVCSBI). <br /><br /> 

Having a baby at the age of 15 is not easy, but I will do all to give my daughter a good life because all of this is for her and to my parents who does not abandoned me in this situation that is so difficult. My daughter is the one of my reason why I'm not giving up, she always make me feel happy when I was so sad when I see her smiling and looking at me I feel okay. Now, my daughter is a blessing in my life she make me stronger even my life is full of difficult situation. <br /><br />

My hobbies are cooking, and traveling. I love to cook for my family this is how I show my love for them and to make them feel special. I also love traveling, but my wallet doesn't seem to cooperate, kidding aside. I really love traveling to explore different places, to meet and to make new friends and create an unforgettable
moments and experience. <br /><br /> 

I like to be a Flight Attendant, because I think working in an environment that continually upholds high levels standard of service as a flight attendant is very challenging the kind of challenge I enjoy. As a flight attendant, you have the opportunity to explore the world, meet new people and help passengers have a safe and comfortable flight. These are just some of the reasons why becoming a flight attendant is such an exciting career choice. One of the best things about being a flight attendant is the opportunity to travel. As a flight attendant, you'll have the chance to visit different destinations all over the world that you might never have seen otherwise. You'll get to experience different cultures, try new foods, and see some of the most beautiful sights that the world has to offer. <br /><br />

I have a big dreams for myself and for my family. I am trying to achieve some goals to help me get what I dream of. But my laziness is a hindrance and destroy my spirit. One of my weaknesses is that I overthink a lot, and sometimes it affects my performance in everything. I hope I will successfully achieve what I want. I want to give my family, my daughter, and  myself a better life that we deserve. 'Cause my biggest inspiration in life is my daughter. <br /><br />
