            “Live at the Moment: A Short Autobiography” <br /><br />

 

                 “Just live life the way that you want it”. For the past months, I have been reflecting on myself and my life. I have been looking for ways to motivate myself and know more about me, and in those moments, I started to realize I have never really tried to be myself and just feel free to live at the moment. I realized that I had always been stuck between two things, thinking about the things that I had done in the past, and pressuring myself to do things better and become a better person for the future. Looking at it may seem simple, but I know that this is one of the most valuable things that we should be able to do in our life. <br /><br />

                On the 17th of January of 2006, I was born as a healthy and as what my mom described me, an “ugly” baby. With a dark skin and quite prominent nose, it became a shock for my mom, considering that she has very light features, ones that can be considered as Eurocentric. But good thing, it only lasted for that one moment because she did what mothers always do to their newborn child, love and appreciate. But even if my mom had said that about me, she actually has a good taste when it comes to names because she named the best possible name that I could think of and ones that fits me the best. <br /><br />

                   My full name is Ma. Jasmin Niña Seguin Pingul. My mom named me “Ma.” or “Maria” after Mama Mary. My father suggested the name “Jasmin” because according to him, it is his and my mom’s name mixed. I am still confused how my father got my name from their name, considering that their names are John and Menche. But either way, I wouldn’t change any of it because I know that it already fits my personality just fine and I probably would’ve got something a lot worse, which is something that I would never want. With the fact that I was born in Cebu during the Sinulog Festival, it wouldn’t be a surprise that my mom named me “Niña”, which is of course, after the Sto. Niño. <br /><br />

               Months after my birth, my mom got pregnant with my first younger brother. At that time, we were still living at Mandaue City in Cebu, but my parents decided to move to Pangasinan, where my mom’s hometown is, so that she could spend her pregnancy near my grandma. I spent my first birthday in this town. I had a big party, with lots of gifts, balloons, a big cake, and even a letchon. Honestly, it was quite a lot of stuff for a birthday that I wouldn’t even remember but it happened already, and I am thankful for it, I guess.  <br /><br />

               Three months after the grand birthday that I had, my brother, John Michael, was born. I don’t remember much about what happened in those years because I was a baby. But all I know is that my brother being part of our family is a blessing for all of us. After my brother was born, we moved to the place where I grew up, in Los Baños, Laguna. A few months after living there, my mom got pregnant again but now with my youngest brother, Michael Andrew. I remember telling my mom that my youngest brother looks like an aswang, which is a mythical creature, because he had long nails which really scared me and my younger brother when we were kids. <br /><br />

                 I spent most of my childhood in this town with my mom and my brothers. We created a lot of memories there. I even remember celebrating my 7th birthday at the park inside the UPLB campus with my mom, my brothers, and my mom’s friends. I didn’t have a big party this time, it was just a simple picnic party with simple foods and simple gifts. But I remember feeling very happy at that moment because I felt like I was very special and very loved. I treasure this moment so much that up until now, I still have the gifts that my mom’s friends gave me. I still had the Barbie doll that they gave me, even if it looks a little messed up, I still care for it, and the mini size version of all the Disney princess’ books. <br /><br />

                 This part of my life is what I would consider as the easiest and most carefree part of my family, excluding the fact that I am just a kid at this point. We can afford all the basic things that one family needs to be able to survive, and I, together with my two brothers are all studying at a great private school in that town. It seems like everything is going great for all of us, but of course, life can’t always be good. <br /><br />

                  Problems started coming in like a flash flood entering a person’s home. My father, who we weren’t able to spend a lot of time with, due to his job as a seafarer, started to physically hurt my mom. He was also caught cheating, which started a lot more problems. All these problems caused my mom to move back to her hometown in Pangasinan with us. We went back and forth from Pangasinan to Laguna for a long time. And in 2015, my mother decided to permanently move to Pangasinan. It was a big adjustment for us, and I didn’t really want to move because all my friends were in Laguna, and I was happy, but I understood why my mom decided to do that and I knew that it was for our own good. <br /><br />

                 This one exact moment changed the way that I view the world. It showed me that things can’t always work out and be nice and good. Life is not like the fairytales that I watched as a kid. It is very far from it. It made me feel like I needed to grow up fast and always think like an adult, and for some reason, I always felt the need to be validated by others. Some people would say that, it’s just part of growing up but I was nine and I knew that it felt different and that something is wrong. I’ve started to feel like something inside me is missing. So, I started to “fix myself”. I always made sure that I speak, eat, and walk in a certain way, a way that I think other people would like and approve of. So that at least, I would feel like that void inside of me is filled, but it never did. I still felt like something is missing but I just can’t know what it is. <br /><br />

                     The feeling of emptiness made me feel so desperate that I decided to literally copy the way that other people do things. I started to become other people’s reflection. It’s almost like I don’t have my own personality anymore because I am trying so hard to be them. Even when it comes to decisions, I would always ask for their opinion, whether they like it or not, and whether they agree with it or not. I struggled with this feeling for years, until 2021, when I decided to focus on myself and help myself up. I am not going to lie that it did help me feel better, it took away the feeling of having the need to copy other people just to make myself feel a lot better but that void and feeling of emptiness still remains. <br /><br />

                     Up until the present day, I still feel so empty, up to the point where I do not know what to feel. I know that usually when things are at the present setting, everything is great and good and that I should’ve already solved this and improved myself, but I am still trying to learn a lot of things about me and the world. I know that in the right time I would be able to conquer this emptiness inside of me. It may not be today, but I know I will someday. But the best thing that I can do today, is just live life the way I want it.
