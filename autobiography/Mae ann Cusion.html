          <p>
            Have you ever wondered what life is like for someone like me? Hi, My name is Mae-Ann C. Cuison and I was born on May 02, 2006, at San Vicente Bayambang Pangasinan. I am a product of province life, I was born and raised there with my parents. Life there was so simple, away from pollution and away from new techs, however, life is still difficult for us to survive on day to day basis. <br /><br />

I am the 5th of 8 siblings, my father was a carpenter and my mother is taking care of us. During the night time, even though my father is tired, he still works overtime to buy rice and our allowance every day in school. Me and my siblings will also try our luck on weekends and holidays I and my siblings wake up earlier to help our mother with household chores to make them easier so that we can cook food especially for our father that is tired from work so that he can rest properly after eating because our father never wastes a day because even on Saturdays and Sundays, he is still working for us to buy us a food so that we can have something to eat, to relieve our father's fatigue when he comes home we greet him with a tight hug. This has been our routine for so many years I must say that I would never be ashamed of having this kind of life but instead grateful for it because it does not only build me as a better person now but thinking that I was blessed enough to have the people around me that loved and cared for me. <br /><br />

In addition, it's not easy for us to make money for our everyday needs but we are very happy way back there as we have each other through thick and thin. Furthermore, we also experienced being nothing and struggle due to financial problems but we remain steadfast and facing all those arduous situations with a positive outlook. All of the hardships that I encountered way back then, mold me to be the firm and wise woman now. <br /><br />

I had graduated my Elementary in the province and finished my grade 10 at Bilad High School Camiling Tarlac being a consistent honor student and now Grade 12 student in St. Vincent's Catholic School of Bayambang Inc. and here became the first batch of government scholars from my voucher which the government provides for those Junior High School students particularly me who are coming from public school. <br /><br />

I endured so many obstacles and downs during my grade 11 as a part Senior High School life sometimes feel depressed it's because I can't balance my time properly between my responsibilities at house and school works. I also do a part-time job at that time and it wouldn't easy for me to manage everything. But thinking with my family would help me boost my strength and keeps me going. Since I am a working student I am lucky to have a very caring Boss but she was told me that can I treat her as my sister. She encouraged me to move forward and continue learning. My Senior High life was so exhausted, many challenges, a lot of learnings, and fond memories that I cherish forever. <br /><br />
