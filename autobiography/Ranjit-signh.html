          <p>
            Hello, I'm Ranjit F. Singh, and my story begins in the small town of Sinabaan, Pangasinan. I'm 18 years old, a mix of Indian and Filipino heritage, thanks to my loving parents, Shingara and Noemi.
            Growing up in Sinabaan was vibrant, with wonderful smiles, festive celebrations, and a strong sense of community. These early years taught me the importance of family, unity, and embracing diversity. I started my education at Mother Goose School in Bayambang, where I made my first friends. School was more than just books; it was about forming friendships and learning from experiences. <br /><br />
            Basketball became my passion even before high school. It taught me discipline, teamwork, and determination, becoming a significant part of my life. As I entered Bautista National High School, I continued to pursue basketball. These years were filled with hard work, both in academics and on the court. It was during this time that I met someone extraordinary who has been my girlfriend for a remarkable five years, supporting me through life's ups and downs. <br /><br />
            Apart from my girlfriend, I deeply cherish my family. My younger sister, Jesha, holds a special place in my heart, her smile capable of brightening even the darkest days. My parents, Shingara and Noemi, are my pillars of strength and the guiding lights in my life. Their love and guidance have profoundly shaped me into the person I am today, and I'm eternally grateful for their unwavering support. <br /><br />
            Later, I moved to our school, SVCSBI, seeking new adventures and experiences. SVCSBI broadened my horizons, introduced me to diverse perspectives, and fueled my dream of making a positive impact on my community. Now, on the cusp of adulthood, I'm taking a significant step toward that dream by running for the position of SK Chairman in our barangay. My aspiration is to serve the people and give back to the community that has played an instrumental role in shaping me. <br /><br />
            My journey has been marked by experiences, friendships, and love. It's about discovering my passions, learning from challenges, and seizing opportunities. Values imparted by my family, friendships forged, and lessons learned in school and my everyday experiences have sculpted my character. As I move forward, I carry with me the richness of my past and the hope for a brighter future. My autobiography stands as a testament to the power of community, the importance of education, the love for sports, and the drive to make a positive difference. The pages of my life continue to turn, and I'm excited to see where this journey leads. Thank you for being a part of it. <br /><br />
