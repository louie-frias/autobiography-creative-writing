          <h2 class="">Niel Ventura</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Neil Florenz G. Ventura also know as Bonel and I'm 17 years old I was born on January 18, 2006 in Bayambang Pangasinan. I'm a grade 12 student in St. Vincent Catholic School of Bayambang Inc. In the section of St. Ambrose of Milan and the name of our adviser is Ma'am Danica S. Cuartero and my hobbies is playing basketball, volleyball, biking, and eating. We are five siblings in our family, my mother's name is Florenda G. Ventura and she live in Wawa Bayambang, Pangasinan and my father's name is Noel G. Ventura and his job is a Farmer. <br /><br />

            I'm the type of person who doesn't know how to make amends to others even when I'm hurt by what they say and I don't know how to hold grudges against anyone, I can easily forget my problems in life. My dream in life is to become a Soldier, I intend to study at PMA in Baguio but I'm not sure yet because I'm a delegate. So, I'm wondering if I'll take criminology when I finish grade 12 and I want to study well so that I can repay my parents for the sacrifice they made with me and my siblings because I saw all the hardships they put in so that we could all study and provide for our needs.  <br /><br />
            
            I also always want to hang out with my friends, talk to them and play basketball because that's what we like to be friends with every afternoon, and I grew up right because of my parents because they taught me the right behavior and the same with my brothers and sisters, we all have a good heart even if sometimes I am a reprimanded child and a bully. <br /><br />
            
            I used to have no interest in my studies and I was just playing and making trouble in class. But when I was in grade 11 he took my studies seriously because I wanted to finish and make my parents proud of me. When I wss grade 11 I'm a Director List Awardee and it feels so good that I'm not like before that I don't know anything about studying. So, I'm studying hard so I don't have any regrets in the end. It's also for my future so I want to study and finish. <br /><br />
            
            I'm dating a girl and I love her so much even though I feel like I'm crazy because I'm the kind of person who will do anything just to get what I'm dreaming of. So, I won't stop dating until I get her answer. My favorite dish is Adobo, because my mother cooks dishes very well. So, almost every dish is my favorite but my favorite is Adobo and my favorite color is blue and white. <br /><br />
            
            Every Christmas I save a lot of money because of my Aunts and Uncles that gave to me, my height is 5'4, and I also like to bike every afternoon because it's nice to bike I forget my problems every time I pedal and see the sunset. I'm a nice person and I don't get very angry because I don't know how to get angry, it just depends on what someone does to me. I also make friends easily because I laugh and get along well with my fellow man. <br /><br />
            
            The things I will never forget in my life is when I was young I almost got run over by a big truck because I ran down the road, luckily someone saw me and saved me, and when my grandmother died because of that the most painful thing happened to me because since I was young, my grandmother was my life partner and she taught me good manners. And the things that I'm afraid of are snakes and ghosts. Ever since I was young, I have been afraid of those two because I thought ghosts were real but I have never seen a ghost, and I am also afraid of losing the my parents by my side because no one will guide me whenever I am if I'm in trouble and need someone to be with, to teach me the right lessons in life. <br /><br />
