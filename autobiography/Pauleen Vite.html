          <h2 class="">Pauleen Vite</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Pauleen, 17 years old from Pangdel, Bayambang, Pangasinan. There's a lot of things I like, I like to have fun with my friends, to play volleyball, online games and I love cooking. My favorite dish is adobo, I also like jokes. The things I don't like is okra, I really hate okra another thing is I don't like pumpkin soap, for me it's because it is so soft in the mouth. <br /><br />

            So, far I have told you about my life. My dad is my favorite because he is a very good parent. He works every day for our needs so, that we can eat every day. I am very happy with the family I have. I love my parents very much because I always feel their love. I'm the eldest of my three siblings. My dad wants me to be a flight attendant so I can imitate my sister if I finish flight attendant and another thing that makes me happy is my friends and loved ones. <br /><br />
            
            I used to watching kdrama, I love playing online games, and my hobby is watching tiktok  when we don't have anything to do in school we go to visit our cousin who died of cancer. I always pray that after I finish my studies, I can reach my father's dream, and give them what they need. My challenge in life is to be able to finish school and work hard to reach my dreams. <br /><br />
            
            When I was young I was very traumatized by the dog because I was bitten several times there was a time I didn't tell because I was afraid that they might scold me especially my dad I didn't say it until he asked what happened to me if I was bitten by a dog they said "I would die" that's why I told my mom that night and she scolded me because I didn't tell her earlier that's why I'm not close to the dog anymore because I feel like they going to bite me again and when I was a teenager. <br /><br />
            
            I had a lot of insecurities because I had a lot of pimples. I thought I was the only one who was ugly because when I was in grade 7 to 8, there was a time when I was scolded because of my pimples. They asked me what happened to my face, "Why did I have so many pimples?" They say "You're just beautiful in the picture but in person it's not" it is so painful just to think that I'm not beautiful like other people I'm just crying why am I like this. My plan is that I will not go to college because I will be taken abroad to work. My brother and sister will only study because he is smart so that I can provide for my family's needs and buy things. They want it and it makes me cry a lot especially when I see mom and dad who are also tired from their work so I always think that even if I don't go to college anymore, it's hard, I'd rather take a job abroad even though it's hard to be away from my family. <br /><br />
