          <h2 class="">Kurt Aron Galsim</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Kurt Aron A. Galsim and i'm 17 years old I was born on December 28, 2005 in Bayambang Pangasinan, i'm a grade 12 student that took academic track in the strand of HUMSS at Saint Vincent Catholic School Of Bayambang, Inc. (SVCSBI). My parents are Lorena A. Galsim and Arnel M. Galsim my mother is working abroad as an OFW to provide a financial support for us while my father are fruit vendor, and takes a good care and guides me and my older sister. There are only two of us sibling and her name is Leiann A. Galsim, she graduated with a degree of early childhood of Education at Pangasinan State University Bayambang Campus.  <br /><br />

I started school when I was 6 years old. I went to Elementary in Bautista Central School from grade 1 to grade 6. Then I joined boys scout when I was in grade 5 and 6  I got a medal during my graduation for joining the boys scouts. Then I attended Bautista National Highschool from grade 7 to grade 10. Then after finishing grade 10 my parents wanted me to study at Saint Vincent Catholic School Of Bayambang, Inc, for my Senior Highschool, and currently I am now a senior highschool at Saint Vincent Catholic School Of Bayambang, Inc.(SVCSBI).  <br /><br />

There are alot of things that I want and a few things that I dont like. I like having fun with my friends and going somewhere with them, and playing online games with them. Sometimes I also prefer to stay at home and eat while watching some kdramas/movies and reading manhwa/comics. And I also enjoy playing badminton with my cousins during weekends. The thing that I dont like the most is that when someone bothers me and im doing something that I like to do in my free time and it gets me mad. I can say that our family is in good condition and I'm very lucky to have a complete family. We have experienced so many difficulties in life but we never let them to break our family. <br /><br />

My dream job is to be a Police Officer of the Philipines, it has been my dream ever since I was a kid. There are many reasons to why it's my dream to become a Police Officer, but Im going to say one of my reasons of why I would like to be a police officer. "To Serve and Protect", a phrase known by everyone, but only a few know the meaning and are willing to live by it. As a Police Officer it is their duty to serve and be loyal to their county, along with their officers and to do anything in their power to protect. I know what it takes to see and understand the dangers of life. To prevent harm and ensure the safety of others, I believe, it's is a very valuable trait to find in one applying to be an officer of the law. This is something I pride myself in. Some people in my age seem want to stay away from the word "responsibilities". The way I look at it, is the more responsibilities the greater the accomplishments. <br /><br />
