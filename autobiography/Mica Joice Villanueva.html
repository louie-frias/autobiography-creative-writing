          <h2 class="">Mica Joice Villanueva</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Mica Joice Velasco Villanueva, 18 years of age, born on 4th day of December 2004 at Anulid, Alcala, Pangasinan. We are three siblings in the family, I am the oldest child. My mother's name is Maricar Blanco Velasco, she's from Anulid, Alcala, Pangasinan and she is a Volunteer Barangay Health Worker and my father’s name is Jovan Matias Villanueva from San Alejandro, Sta. Maria, Pangasinan, a Laborer. Im a Grade 12 student at Saint Vincent Catholic School Bayambang INC. In strand of HUMSS, I had a happy childhood living with my parents and my siblings in Anulid, Alcala, Pangasinan. <br /><br />
I took my Elementary Education at Anulid Elementary School and my Junior High at Eastern Pangasinan Agricultural College at Sta. Maria, Pangasinan. I was a quiet and shy child. I’m staying at home at all times, helping my mother work at home. During my school days in Elementary, I am not the child that had many friends, I’m stayed at the one side of our classroom. Later on, I’m playing with my new friends. <br /><br />
My childhood dream is to become a Teacher or took a Criminology as my father wants me to become. I have many dreams in life, I will do everything so that my dreams will make come true together with my family. <br /><br />

My earliest memory is together with my family bonding, playing and go to church. I am grateful to my parents because they are the one who gaved me life aside to beloved God, without them, I am not here at the top of this world. They gaved all the best they can in order to survived our family and makes us good as they want. <br /><br />
Also to my teachers who’s not surrender to teach us no matter it is hard to learned, they gaved their all best as long as we learned. The main lesson that my parents taught me was, be humble, knowing where are you from, and do not judge other people. Just believe in my self especially don’t miss to call and give thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ. <br /><br />

My motto in life is "Try and try until you succeed." Never give up because time will come, our dreams will make come true, just believe in ourselves, and do all the best we can do. <br /><br />
During vacation, we helped each other in our daily activities at home. My family was a happy and a loving parents. Even we had a problem, we are still strong and face it all. My life is quiet and simple, I have many important people in my life that helped shape me into the person I am today. I have my family, my friends, and even other people who have influenced me. My parents are the best parents out there. They are kind, caring, and compassionate while also guiding me to make smart decision on my own. <br /><br />
They helped me, by showing me what is the right and what is wrong. I think this is most important lesson they have taught me. I do not like to be in trouble, my dream in life is to finish my study, and I can stand on my own. To make my parents proud and give them a safe and beautiful life with my two siblings. <br /><br />
