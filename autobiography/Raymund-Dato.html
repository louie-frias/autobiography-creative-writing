          <h2 class="">Raymund Dato</h2>
          <p>
            I used to say "I'm okay" even though I know to my self that I'm not I'm not really okay because I want to show for them that I'm strong strong enough to face any kind of battles in life as I grow up everything change even those people around us so I have to adapt on that environment that full of toxic people I'm always silent cause I'm fluent in silence but it doesn't mean that my eyes is close and my ear is close it's just my mouth I always observe everything around me and analyze the way they think and act that's why I'm aware of everything  <br /><br />
            I am Raymund C. Dato and I'm here to tell you what life is and how does people overcome their problems in life. I'm a innocent child before that doesn't know that I will come on this kind of situation that life is very hard now compared to past. When I was a child I don't really enjoy being a child yes I try to play with my cousins and friends to have fun I also do shameless things in my life that makes me happy also but when I entered at Elementary School always quite in the side afraid of stranger people then there's a people that talk to me and have fun with me and I can talk to when there's a lesson that I didn't get. And now, entering the Junior High School there's a lot of hard things to do specially in projects, assignments etc. And when old friends gone there's a new friends that come the one that you can talk to when you have a problem they will comfort you, give some advices and make you laugh even though your crying, the one that you can ask if he/she is free to have some time together, the one that you trust in everything specially in your secrets. I feel so blessed with them cause I have a friends that always there for me.  <br /><br />
            I also learned to love a person that gives me motivation and inspiration he always make me laugh which I like and having a quality time, but sadly we didn't last because all I know is he really loves me but when a message came to his phone and I read it my whole world is fall because he betrayed me I thought he will never hurt me but it's not he toyed me and had a relationship with a girl and the girl doesn't know about our relationship. So, I broke up with him and let it go because I don't want to make any issue and hurt her because I know what it feels to be hurt like that. He please me to not broke up with him but my mind doesn't change even my heart says "I still love him" so I have to follow my mind than my heart cause if he really loves me he will never ever gonna hurt me and fooled me but he said "No, please! I'm begging you let's fix this" and I answered "No! We don't have to fix anything, you lied to me, you betrayed me, and most of all you hurt me so much. All I do is to love you but this? All you did to me is to fooled me with your lies and didn't do what you promise to me" he answered again "If you want me to broke up with her I will do it, just don't breake up with me" I answered again "No! Don't do it, don't hurt her the way you hurt me. You can't fix the mistake with another mistake, but I just want to say something to you DON'T EVER HURT SOMEONE THAT ALL HE/SHE DO IS TO LOVE YOU!" and leave him with a smile while still crying. But deep inside it's really really hard to make a decision like that, I cried a lot in my bedroom in silent even my pillow and blanket is wet because of my tears. After that we never stare and talk each other and never had a closure that's my biggest mistake loving someone that never love me back. I had a lot of relationship but this is my unforgettable love I had and after that I lose hope that someone will love me purely and genuine the way I do. I lost interest in love and I focus on my study.  <br /><br />
            When the Covid-19 comes everything change, all friends that I have is gone and there's a few that stay so I'm proud of them because they prove to me that they are a real friends to me. When the Covid come the learning system is change so we have to stay at home for almost 2 years so that virus is not be spread to the person we love cause the Covid virus is everywhere. We need to adapt in Online class learning so that we can continue to study but even though we're studying we can't imagine that it is very hard to adapt on it cause not all of the students have a gadgets and can provide an Internet connection. There's a lot of students like me that having difficulties in that cause we can't do the usual things we do. I experience anxiety and stress in my life and I kept it my self so that my family won't worry about me cause I'm scared and I don't want to be a problem for them. So as long as I can handle I will kept, I learned to fight alone, and I learned to be stronger. But after that I realized that I changed a lot cause I don't socialize with other people the way I do before, I can't even have time with my own friends, and talk to them specially about my experience cause I don't want them to worry about me. And then when the scientist create and develop the vaccine for Covid virus the usual thing we're doing is gradually going back, but still implementing the guidelines to wear face mask and bring alcohol.  <br /><br />
            Our face mask is not also to protect us but for me it is a way to cover our smile we can't even understand each other when wearing it so we need to shout it to each other. I realized that this face mask is also covering me to not show how sad I am and I'm glad of that but then there's always a way to show our feelings and is our eyes I'm glad and so proud that there's a person that notice that I'm not okay but still I always say that "No, I'm okay thanks for asking" even though I know to myself that i'am actually not so yeah yes I am one of the best liar when it comes to answer that question. I can't feel anything I feel empty I don't know how to explain my feeling cause there is something in my self that is so heavy so I just keep quite and keep it to myself. When we are back to school I didn't get any awards in 2 years I'm so disappointed to myself because I didn't maintain to have a awards cause when I was Elementary I always have awards and medal so when I'm a Grade 10 I always say to myself that "I need to get back to have awards or honor again" and then I graduated and I'm proud to my self that I fulfil my promise to myself that I will be graduated with honor.  <br /><br />
            When I'm at lowest point there's a thing that always give you not just a message, not just a comforts, but to reduce your stress in life and that is Music, I really love music not just because of the the Artist or Singer who made a song but all the messages they put in it. It shapes a persons life and change the perspective in life. So, I'm glad that music is always there to make us feel the not just the beat or melody but to make us express our emotions through listening to music and there's a lot of genre of it pop, love, rock etc. And there's a music where you can dance and make you feel happy and enjoy it. Thanks to music because it has a lot of good impact for those people having stress because they reducing it and my life is changing little by little because of good influence of it.  <br /><br /> 
            When I'm a Senior High School student I failed again, in the first quarter of first semester when I'm a Grade 11 I didn't get a award and I say it again to my parents and they said that "It's okay son, you did your best. Always remember that there is always a chance to get what you want" so I try again and do my best and then in second quarter I get it I get a award untill I finished Grade 11. Now, there's a lot of people asking me "Are you single?" And I answered "Yes, I am why?" And they start courting me and you know what? Nobody wins my heart because when they are courting me there are some of them that want to just use me, take advantage of what I have, and just to try to love me and if it fails they will find a girl that is better than me. And there are some that are serious to me but I rejected them all because I'm scared, I'm scared that what if they hurt me again like others? What if it is worse relationship that I may have if I accept them? What if that relationship won't last? There's a lot of what ifs in my mind everytime someone is courting me. Cause maybe some of them is really serious but they want to get they want in fast, because I believe that if you really love a someone you are willing to stay and wait for him/her until he's/she's ready for it and you are willing to prove yourself that you are different with other people while getting to know each other and most of all if they will respect your decision that you are not ready or you don't want a relationship with them right now. Cause there's a right time for all specially in love, wait until a pure and genuine love comes  <br /><br />
            Now that I'm a Grade 12 I aim again to get an award I want even tough i'm pressuring myself to get it, having a short time of sleep, and not eating breakfast or dinner. I have to do it because I don't want to be disappointed in myself again. Until now, I still don't know what I feel. I feel so empty and I don't know myself right now because of a lot of things happen to me. Sometimes my tears go down without any reason I don't know but it is very hard to have this kind of feeling that you can't explain. That's why when I graduate as a Senior High I will take a Psychology not just to understand how people think and act but to heal and find myself and most of all to help people when it comes to their problems in life if they want a advice and comforts I will give it and I will the the person who always listen to them cause I know the feeling of you don't have a person you can talk about their problems and I know the feeling of being a prison in your own mind. So, I have to fight and be stronger than before, cause I know that there's a lot of things will come to me and I know that It won't be easy when you are in College. So, I have to be prepare and know what path is right for me so I will never have a regrets in my life again. And I want to make sure that all my dreams will come true to be successful in life, and have a bright future of my family.  <br /><br />
