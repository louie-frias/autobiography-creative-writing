          <h2 class="">Brent-Senara</h2>
          <p>
            My mother gave birth on June 24, 2006. “A legend was born” It was me Brent Andrei C. Señara my mom’s name is Bryna and my dad’s name is Bryan. My mom hade me at the age of twenty, she’s still studying to become a nurse, since my mom is at school, my lola and lolo is the one who’s taking care of me, i’m very thankful that I have a grandparents that is caring and loving, meanwhile mom didn’t give up pursuing her dreams. My mother raised me so well despite having me at the early age, She worked hard to fulfill my needs, I can say that she is the best Mother in the whole wide world. I was four years old, FOUR YEARS OLD, I saw them with my two eyes arguing, I asked my mom what happened, mom said she caught my dad with another woman, then boom, my parents got separated, I didn’t really care about it, but as soon I grow up, things got different, I got bullied by my classmates because my parents are separated, I didn’t mind them. As soon I become a grade 7 student, things got worse people in my school gossiping about my chin because I have underbite case, students calling me inappropriate names, there is one time I look at the mirror, pushing my chin really hard, I thought that would work and it did not, but now i’m seventeen I accept what my face shape looked like, because who’s the one gonna love me it’s me. As I grew older, I discovered an escape from the chaos of my family life through video games. The virtual worlds on the screen provided a refuge, a place where I could be someone else, if only for a little while. I delved into the realms of adventure, strategy, and role-playing games, forging friendships and rivalries in the digital landscape, <br /><br />

            That’s right i’m good at video game. I was only child for fourteen years, and an angel was sent to us, her name is Brielle Margaux, my stepsister, my feelings were mix that time, I was like i’m not the favorite anymore, lol, but the time I carried her things got different, I said to my self that i’m a brother now, I need to be responsible since it was quarantine that time, I stopped playing pixels to help my mom babysit Margaux. Covid got ended, face to face classes is back, last year grade 11, I promise to my self to study hard and find a circle of friends that would help each other, I did well that time, I become part of Journalism, I become a consistent with honors, I become a student leader. <br /><br />
           
           Fast forward today, All I can say is that I love my life, i’m so thankful to my mom and to everyone who supported me since day one. As of today my only interest right now is to study hard because i’m a graduating student. I continue my journey through life, I am mindful of the challenges that lie ahead. My family may be broken, but I am determined to create a better future for myself. My autobiography is a testament to my ongoing transformation and self-discovery. I am Brent Andrei C. Señara, a 17-year-old with a unique story, shaped by a broken family. My path may be unconventional, but it is uniquely mine, and I am determined to make the most of it as I journey toward adulthood and the unknown adventures that await. <br /><br />
