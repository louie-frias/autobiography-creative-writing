          <h2 class="">Lordly Solomon</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Lordly Yrone D.S Solomon 17 years old I live in Tanolong, Bayambang, Pangasinan postal code (2423).  What is the story of my life? I am a simple person, a simple young man, with a kind heart, and I have a simple dream in life, that is to finish my studies in college. I am now in grade 12 of HUMSS strand. I'm a happy person, a friendly person, over time I've met many friends, I've made many people happy, but as time goes by, I don't realize that I'm getting older, that I'm losing the people I used to because of that life change, everything change before I was holding toys and balls, now I was holding books, papers, and ballpens. <br /><br />

            In this day and age, I shouldn't only be thinking about games because I'm getting older, what I need right now is learning, why? because we are in the Philippines if you don't have a diploma you are a lowly person who will not respect you anymore so I realized that you should not only have strategy but also intelligence so that you can use it more correctly. <br /><br />
            
            I am a student who wants to become a Policeman or Seaman one day so that I can help my family and so that I can repay them for every sacrifice they make to me because I know that life is hard so it really should be persevere. My father is a farmer and my mother is an OFW at that time, my father was my partner here in the province who also sent me to school. I have a lot of respect for him. <br /><br />
            
            When I was in Elementary School, I was one of the messy kids, I don't care about studying, all I know is to play games, I even remembered that there were 40 of us in the same class and do you know what a top I am? at top 36 I suddenly laughed because I still have a long way to go to be in the top I thought it was easy to study and understand all the subjects but in the exam even though I was hoping to reach a passing score I didn't reach it because I thought the answer would be multiple choice but I was wrong because it turned out to be fill in the blank so since I went to Junior High School I adjusted my studies I became an achiever and I maintained that until I was then. <br /><br />
            
            When I entered Senior High School at first I was shy of my classmates because I didn't know them and through my talkativeness I talked to anyone so that they could become friends and somehow I could talk to someone, it's true It's what they said that "when your in  HUMSS you can get rid of your shame" it's true because not only did I get rid of my shame, because my self-confidence came out even more now I'm a grade 12 student just a little bit and I'll reach my dream my heart is weak so everytime I was feel empty I always pray to God to give me strength and positiveness everytime. <br /><br />
            
            I admit that Senior High School is really hard, but it will be even harder when you get to College, that's when the real battle will begin. I'll have a hard time in college, but I'd rather continue it than stop it. Right now I'm still continuing to study to increase the knowledge that I should know in this world and still working hard for my dream and my philosophy in life is that "Everything will be fine in the end, if it's not fine it's not the end yet" again I'm Lordly Yrone Solomon and this is the story of my life. <br /><br />
