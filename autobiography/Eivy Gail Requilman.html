          <h2 class="">Eivy Gail-Requilman</h2>
          <p>
           Hello everyone!, let’s have a short introduction about myself, I’m Eivy Gale D. Requilman, 17 years old and turning 18 this coming October, my mother gave on me on October 18, 2005. Next let us talk about my nicknames that my friends and family gaves me, so the first one is “Eivy” my friends at school and all of my teachers call me “Eivy” because that’s my first name, the next one is “Ella” I know you’re all thinking where that came from because that’s is so far on my name, so let’s have an short story about that nickname, actually my auntie which is the youngest and only daughter/ sister of my father gave me that nickname, base on their story my auntie gave me that nickname because I’m the first daughter of my parents, the first grand daughter of my grandma and grandpa, and the first niece of my uncle and auntie on father’s side, lastly “Gale” my aunt’s on mother side gave me that nickname because that was my second name. So next lets move to the next topic about me which is the place where I live in, actually when I was 2 years old we go on manila for two years and go back here when I was four years old, the reason why we go back here because my brother is going to have his kindergarten here in bayambang, and until now we’re here studying in Bayambang, so in short we are living in Brgy. Buayaen Bayambang Pangasinan. Next, I want to give you a short story about the schools where I studied and where I currently studying, when I was in elementary days, I was studied at Buayen Central School which is the school in our barangay, and I undergo junior high on Bayambang National High School(BNHS) which one of the famous school in Pangasinan, and now  I transferred on St. Vincent’s Catholic School of Bayambang Inc. (SVCSBI) to continue my highschool which is the senior, and now I was a grade 12 HUMSS student, one of my dream is to be a teacher someday and to achieve that I will do my very so that I will finish my studies and be a professional teacher. Next I want to share the things that I like to do or my hobbies, one of my hobbies is playing badminton and volleyball, I just want to share about why  I love playing volleyball it is because my friends and cousins encourage me to play volleyball and I am one of the player on our purok/barangay, I also love dancing and watching movies and tiktoks.One of my favorite hobbies is memorizing bible verses that can help me or describe me as a person, my favorite bible verse is from Jeremiah 29:11 and this is all about the plan of god in your life and future. I want to share who are my inspirations why I’m strong and doin my best to be successful, my inspirations is my parents because of their hardworking and sacrifices and because of that I inspired to study hard so that I will help them someday, one of my inspirations is my lola who passed away last August 7, 2021 because it was her idea and she pushed me to pursue teacher because I being tutor of my nephew and niece during pandemic. Let’s talk about the thing I love, the first thing that I love is to have bonding on my family or to have a quality time with them, and I want to have a bond also on my friends and my boyfriend, because they are the one who make me laugh and also be a strong woman. So that’s the important thing in my life I hope you like it and I hope I give you an idea on who I am and what I am.
