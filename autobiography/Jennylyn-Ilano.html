          <h2 class="">Jennylyn Ilano</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Jennylyn Ilano, 17 years old,  From sto. Namualan sur Diaz Bautista Pangasinan. And my story are all joys comes with sadness.  since I was born I didn't have a father because my father was also got another women pregnant  and he didn't know that my mother was also pregnant, he left my mother without knowing that she was pregnant, and according to my mother's story. . . He went to Cavite to look for my father in Cavite but he could not find him, my mother cried a lot because she loved my father very much. And when I was born, my grandfather was my father, my grandfather was our mother's father, he made me feel the love of a father, he always dressed me, he combed my hair, he fixed me, he also bathed me. he and I always slept next to each other when I was young. And when I was studying daker, my grandmother taught me because my mother was busy at work, so that my mother could support my siblings and I's studies. So my grandmother always took me and taught me. We always walk to school but when I'm tired, grandma lifts me up and when I go to school, she teaches me spelling, alphabet and counting so I'm the top of our class. When I was in grade one, my grandmother was the one who delivered me, she was the one who always delivered me. yes, I didn't go to kindergarten, I went to grade one right away because the teachers saw that I could keep up, ok Let's go back to when I was in grade one. Since I was in grade one, I started getting sick. I always have a fever and yes when I get sick, it takes weeks for me to recover until I lose weight and my grandfather always takes care of me. he is always by my side, he never disappears. Mom also takes care of me when she comes home from work even though she is very tired, she still takes care of me. And when I was in grade three, my father came to our house, he just visited us. I was with him less than a day when I first saw him I was shy and happy because since I was born that time was the only time I was with him and saw him, and he hugged me tightly, and he also talked to the grandfather and grandmother but he didn't talk to my mom because my mom doesn't come to the other house because she's not ready to talk to my dad yet because she still loves him very much but she's very happy. he was very happy because we could be with and bond with our father even if it was just for a few hours... My dad took us to SM, we ate at Jollibee, played games and took pictures and I enjoyed that time, but even when I was young I told myself I wish mom was with us because that's what I want, I want of experience. the whole family and just happy, bonding like that. And then we went home that afternoon and my father drove us home and he said goodbye to our grandfather and grandmother who was leaving to go home to Cavite.... Let's go back to my grandfather when I was sick, he was the one who always took care of me when my mother wasn't there, because when I was a child my knee always hurt, I don't know but suddenly it started to hurt, just get cold and it will hurt immediately , every night and every day my grandfather was touching my knees and every night and every day I cried, There was even a night when my knee hurt and grandpa couldn't sleep at that time because I was crying all night and my knee hurt all night, my grandpa was always by my side because I couldn't sleep without him by my side because I always wants me to hug him and he always scratches my back and he always fans me until I fall asleep. <br /><br />
 
During the vacation in grade 6, dad took us on vacation in Cavite with his new wife and new wife's son. I'm having second thoughts because I don't want to leave grandpa because I'll miss him so much, but I'm also excited because I'll be with my dad and that's the second time I'll see my dad at that time. I will be with him for the first time with my father in the same house. when we were in Cavite, my brother, at first I was still shy and I was still adjusting, but after a while I started to enjoy it, we always climbed my brother's mango tree and sometimes we ate mangoes from the tree itself, it was delicious because the mango sweetness. Yes, it's their mangoes, dad, because on the side of their house, dad, they grow mangoes, avocados, and bananas, but I only eat mangoes out of those three, because I don't like the taste of avocados either. And when every day I climb and eat on the very mango tree and my father sees me he tells me that I might fall because if I fall there I will die because I will fall in the  cliff. I am close to my father's new wife but his new wife's son is not because they say he is cursed, My father's new wife was very nice, sister and brother said that the father's new wife  was really nice. because my older brother is already studying in Cavite and dad's new wife and dad are with him, and my sister also vacationed there with her, dad's older brother and dad's new wife. At that time, I was not allowed to go on vacation because I was too young. <br /><br />
 Let's go back to the mango, the day there was a house of bees in the mango, my brother , sister and I threw stones at the house of bees until the bees came out but we were not chased because we were inside the house while we were throwing stones at the house with bees, and the person chased that day is the old man who gives wood to every house for a fence, We three siblings were very happy because the old man was chased and bitten. We were happy because the old man looked funny that day. HAHAHAHA but our father didn't find out because if our father found out I'm sure that he would be angry with us, until now I still laugh when I think about it. The day came when I told my sister and brother that we are going home because I miss my grandfather so much...And when I got home, I hugged my grandfather tightly
And the day came when mom went abroad to work because  sister and brother and I were in high school when I was in grade seven in the 4th quarter, she was taking care of her paperwork for leaving for another country and she was always away from home, my grandfather and grandmother always take care of me and sometimes my siblings take care of me because I didn't know anything to do at that time because I was also spoiled by my grandfather, he didn't make me mobilized when I worked inside the house just cleaning, but only once because my grandfather scolded them when I was made to work. During the vacation in grade seven, mom left and my siblings and I were sent to Cavite and studied there, yes, I didn't stay long in Cavite, maybe I was only there until the 1st quarter of grade 8. They only forced me to study there so that my father could watch over me there, (I said to myself then that I can study here because my grandfather and grandmother will watch over me here), but I told mom I don't want to go and I don't want to go to Cavite and study there but I didn't do anything because mom wanted me and my siblings to be together so I studied in Cavite... And the day came when my grandfather took us to Cavite. Yes, they rented a house in Cavite, let's go back to when my grandfather brought us to Cavite, when we were in the house, I didn't leave my grandfather's side until he left and he went home in panggasinan because my grandfather just rested  by little and then went home immediately. <br /><br />

When my grandfather left, I immediately went to the room and cried because I always wanted to be by his side, but that's not what mom wanted. yes, by the way, my brothers and I are with my father's son from another woman, Borjo, who is almost the same age as me because we are only 6 months apart he was papa's son with another woman when he left my mom while he didn't know that my mom was pregnant . I also became close to Borjo because he is also kind, but it irritates me when he calls me sister I don't know why I just get irritated and annoyed. On my first night in Cavite, Borjo was next to me and we talked about his mother and my mother, Our mom is just as grumpy but hers is worse because his mother seems to be insanely ill and he said that our father took him because his mother tortured him there, we just talked and talked until we both fell asleep. When my first day of school started in grade 8, my first day of school was good, I made a friend whose name was Cristel, Cristel told me that she went back to school in grade 8 because she stopped, And on my second day, Cristel and I made a new friend, her name is Jasmine, but she is called Tulip. She is also a transfer like me, she became our friend because he sat in my seat and we talked there until she became our friend and as time went on, more and more people became my friends until all of my classmates became my friends and until many people know me, even other sections know me, but i don't know why I was known. <br /><br />
I really enjoyed my studies in Cavite, but I moved because I was not close to my father we fought and fought until I found out that he rejected me when I found out, I did everything just to get back to the panggasinan. I message almost all of my relatives in panggasinan i didn't think about the shame until our first quarter ended and I was allowed to go home in Pangasinanand that's where I continued my studies. Grade 9 has arrived and it is only modules because there is a virus that is spreading,during  vacation in grade 9 I went to church and became a choir I met a lot of people there who became my friends. until the grade 10 modules again because  many people are still sick because of the spreading virus, when I was in grade 10, I was a wanderer, I always ran away on our motorbike to go to my friend's house because at that time I had a lot of problems so I just to going by going to my friend's house because when I'm with them, I forget my problems and I have fun, they always advised me and they became my second family at that time. But my family kept me away from them and they said  to me that stay at home, to the point where I could do it and commit suicide in several times and my family just scolded me and I was told a bad word that was very down until I disobeyed them and approached my friends again and I was very happy again. And when I was in grade 11, I had a lot of problems family problem, my own and then i got  sicker and sicker again until I want to give up and want to die but I don't show others that I'm giving up because I want them to see me happy and strong until this grade 12. <br /><br />
