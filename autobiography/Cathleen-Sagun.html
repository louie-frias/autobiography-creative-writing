          <h2 class="">Cathleen-Sagun</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Cathleen A. Sagun and I’m 17 years old, I was born on November 12, 2005 in Bautista, Pangasinan. I’m a grade 12 student that took academic track in the strand is HUMSS at Saint Vincent Catholic School of Bayambang Inc. My parents are Joanne Sagun and Roberto Sagun. My mother is the one who takes good care and guides me and my siblings while my father is working to provides our needs. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister, the oldest one is my sister named Caryl Jae Sagun he finished High School on Bautista National High School at the age of 19, My sister got a job so instead of studying she chose to work. My youngest brother named Iver Sagun is now grade 1 student at Cabuaan Elementary School. <br /><br />
            I first attend school at the age of 4 and my mother enrolled me as a nursery at the Day Care Center near at our house. When I was a kid, I was forcing my parents to enroll me in a school because when I saw my brother everyday before and after going to school I imagine that school is just like a playground that makes everybody happy where you can also gain more knowledge and friends. But as the time goes by I have experienced and encountered a lot of things in school, until now. I started making memories with my classmates, teachers and friends or should I say my second family and they never failed me to have the best memories and unforgettable moments with them every year. I just found myself in school that is why I love going to school everyday even sometimes it makes me so tired. I do have a lot of dreams in life and I start working of it because I really want to make my dreams comes true. <br /><br />
           There is a lot of things that I like and a few things that I don't like. I like having fun with friends and going somewhere with them. Sometimes I also prefer to stay at home and watched some movies with my family while eating a bunch of salty foods. I also love watching vlogs, lifestyle videos on YouTube and apply those knowledge to myself. The thing that I don't like the most is when someone bothers me and I'm doing an important paper works for school that's the thing that really gets me mad. I can say that our family is in good condition and I'm lucky to have a complete family. We have experienced many difficulties in life but we never let them to break our family. <br /><br />
