          <h2 class="">Jonalyn Cervas</h2>
          <p>
            I am Jonalyn R. Cervas I was born on December 12, 2005 in the Cagayan. I displayed in satiable curiosity about the world around me, my parents separated at my young age I have a twin brother. At my young age I don’t know how to take care my brother, my mother talk to my father to go to her province, I’m sad because I love my father so much but my mother insist that she’s going to take care to me and my brother. <br /><br />
 
The month past my mother have a suitor my mother introduce that guy to me, I don’t know how to express my feeling that time I’m sad and disappointed but I’m stay silent even I don’t understand my situation that time and another year past, my mother build another family a happy family. <br /><br />

My mother want my father to take the responsibility because she needs to focus to her newborn baby, my father refuse and give my brother and I to my mother again. My mother decided that my one brother stay at her while me and my one brother stay at my father, that memories of mine is so painful. <br /><br />

Why my mother give my first pain, why my parents separated without thinking the pain that they cause to their children. Another year past I accept the reality that my mother and father will not back their love, my life became very hard I don’t have a mother that give me advice, teach me to cook, to wash my own clothes. I have so many questions but I keep silent why may mother chose her new family and deprived her first child a happy family, why my parents separated without thinking that their children will be affected.  <br /><br />

And now I’m 17 years old I’m starting to accept the fact that may parent will never be back to the normal as I grew up I realized that my father was there to teach me the things that my mother could not do. But it makes me jealous especially when I see whole family. But I’m also proud and happy that I have my father my life became happy now I have may father my friends because I realize that it’s ok to be alone it’s ok to be feeling incomplete, and as a teenager I excelled academically and participating in various of activities passionate about environmental conservation and dedication much of my free time to help my barangay. <br /><br />

As the eldest I bore the weight of trying to shield my brother from the harsh realities that my brother and I growing up in a broken family, my nights were often filled with sobs and whispered to God to give hope to live for my father to make up for all his suffering. Despite my pain I immersed my self in books, finding solace and scape the reality even in a short of time. Today I look back to my life I see the story of a transformation, from the chaos of my childhood, I emerged as a beacon of hope for the others, using my own experience to guide to the toward brighter more harmonious future. I embodies the strength that can be found in the midst of a broken world. <br /><br />
