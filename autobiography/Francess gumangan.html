          <h2 class="">Franzes Gumaga</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Franzes Rhea E. Gumangan, 17 years old. I was born on September 7, 2006 in Poblacion East, Bautista, Pangasinan. I'm a grade 12  student that took academic track in the strand of HUMSS at Saint Vincent Catholic School Bayambang Inc. (SVCSBI). My parents is Katherine and Ryan Gumangan. My mother is a Costumer Service Representative while my father is a Truck Driver. I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters. The oldest one is Kathleen Rhain E. Gumangan she still studying as a grade 12 student who also took academic track in the strand of HUMSS at SVCSBI, the younger one is Jan Ellyza E. Gumangan graduated as a grade 6 student now studying as a grade 7 student in Bautista National Highschool, my oldest brother is Ryan Ezekiel E. Gumangan also studying at Bautista National Highschool as a grade 9 student, my younger brother is Andrei Jacob E. Gumangan studying at Anulid Elementary School as a grade 5 student. <br /><br />

            I also have a boyfriend right now, giving me a princess treatment, assurance, and efforts. He's always right next to me when I need him, he also prefer to make me laugh, making sure that I'm always okay and taking care of me. <br /><br />
            
            There is a lot of things that I like and a few things that I don't like. I like having fun with my friends and going somewhere with them, sometimes I also prefer to stay at home and watched some movies with my family while eating a bunch of salty foods. I also love watching vlogs, make-up tutorials and life style videos on Youtube and apply those knowledge to my self. The things that I don't like is when someone's talking behind my back about me, inshort backstabbing me and I also don't want to tolerate plastic friends. <br /><br />
            
            I can say that our family is in good condition and I'm lucky to have a complete family. We have experienced many difficulties in life but we never let them to break our family. <br /><br />
            
            Well, by now you might know some of my personality. But, I am going to tell you some more. I think some good points of my personality are that I love music, like jokes, sometimes brave, friendly when it's time to meet friends, and quite sporty since I like Basketball, Badminton, and Volleyball. <br /><br />
            
            I haven't told you of my bad points yet, well, some of my bad points are that I am a little bit forgetful, I am disorganized, and I get angry easy sometimes. Well each person has their own personality and sensitivity. <br /><br />
            
            I hope someday my dreams will come true to become a teacher and have a better life. <br /><br />
